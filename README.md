## Implementation Steps

1. *Data Preparation*
   - Use watsonx.data to ingest and process data from various sources
   - Set up connections to real-time APIs (e.g., IBM Weather API)

2. *Knowledge Base Creation*
   - Index agricultural information in watsonx.data
   - Use watsonx.ai to generate embeddings for efficient retrieval

3. *Model Development*
   - Fine-tune foundation models on agricultural domain using Tuning Studio
   - Develop custom models for specific tasks (e.g., crop recommendation)

4. *Prompt Engineering*
   - Use Prompt Lab to create effective prompts for various farmer queries
   - Design prompts that incorporate real-time data (weather, prices)

5. *Assistant Configuration*
   - Set up intents and entities in Watsonx Assistant
   - Configure dialog flows for different types of agricultural queries

6. *Integration*
   - Connect Watsonx Assistant to fine-tuned models and knowledge base
   - Implement API calls for real-time data within assistant flows

7. *Testing and Refinement*
   - Use watsonx.governance to monitor model performance
   - Continuously improve based on farmer interactions

## Demonstration Scenario

Let's create a demonstration scenario to showcase AgriBuddy's capabilities:


Farmer: "Hello AgriBuddy, I'm planning to plant wheat next week. Any advice?"

AgriBuddy: "Hello! I'd be happy to help you with your wheat planting plans. First, let me check the weather forecast and soil conditions for your area. Could you please confirm your location?"

Farmer: "I'm in Punjab, India."

AgriBuddy: "Thank you. I've checked the forecast for Punjab, India for the coming week. Here's my advice:

1. Weather: The forecast shows mild temperatures and a 60% chance of rain in 3 days. This is favorable for wheat planting.

2. Soil Condition: Based on recent data, soil moisture levels are adequate. However, if it doesn't rain as forecast, consider light irrigation after planting.

3. Variety Selection: For Punjab, varieties like HD-3086 or WH-1105 are recommended for this planting window.

4. Planting Depth: Plant seeds 5-6 cm deep to ensure good germination.

5. Fertilizer: Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer before sowing. The current market price for DAP is â‚¹1350 per 50kg bag.

6. Pest Alert: There's a moderate risk of aphid infestation this season. Monitor your crop regularly after germination.

7. Insurance: The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is currently open for enrollment. Consider insuring your crop against unforeseen weather events.

Would you like more detailed information on any of these points?"

Farmer: "Yes, tell me more about the insurance option."

AgriBuddy: "Certainly! The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a crop insurance scheme backed by the Indian government. Here are the key points for wheat insurance in Punjab:

1. Coverage: It covers losses due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases.
2. Premium: Farmers pay 1.5% of the sum insured for rabi crops like wheat.
3. Deadline: You must enroll before November 30th for wheat sown in the rabi season.
4. Process: You can enroll through local banks, insurance companies, or Common Service Centers.
5. Documents Needed: Proof of land ownership/tenancy, Aadhaar card, and bank account details.

Given the weather patterns and potential pest risks I mentioned earlier, insurance could be a wise choice this season. Would you like help with the enrollment process?"

Farmer: "Not right now, but thanks for the information. One last question - when should I apply the first round of fertilizer?"

AgriBuddy: "Based on best practices for wheat cultivation in Punjab and the current soil conditions:

1. Basal Application: Apply the first round of fertilizer just before or at the time of sowing. This should include all of the phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), and about one-third of the nitrogen (N) requirement.

2. Timing: Given that you're planning to plant next week, prepare for this basal application now.

3. Quantity: For an average yield target, apply about 40 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 40 kg K2O per hectare as a basal dose.

4. Method: Broadcast the fertilizer evenly and incorporate it into the soil during field preparation.

5. Next Round: Plan for the second application of N (about 40 kg/ha) at the crown root initiation stage, typically 21-25 days after sowing.

Remember to adjust these recommendations based on your specific soil test results if available. Would you like me to remind you about the second application when the time comes?"

Farmer: "Yes, please set a reminder. Thank you, AgriBuddy!"

AgriBuddy: "You're welcome! I've set a reminder to notify you about the second fertilizer application in 25 days. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"


This demonstration showcases AgriBuddy's ability to:
1. Provide personalized advice based on location and current conditions
2. Integrate real-time weather data
3. Offer market insights (fertilizer prices)
4. Give specific agricultural recommendations (planting depth, variety selection)
5. Alert about potential risks (pest warnings)
6. Provide information on relevant policies (crop insurance)
7. Offer detailed explanations on agricultural practices (fertilizer application)
8. Set reminders for future actions
